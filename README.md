# Temporally aperiodic SSMs

This package computes non-autonomous spectral submanifolds for four mechanical example situtaions subjected to chaotic forcing. 

The theory, computational methodology and further details on the examples can be found in the following article:

[1] **Haller, G & S.Kaundinya, R. Nonlinear Model Reduction to Temporally Aperiodic Spectral Submanifolds. (To appear in Chaos) (2024). https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05355**

In order to install the program, simply run the install.m file in the main folder. The examples can be found in the examples directory. Note: When running the examples in the livescript files (workbooks), please ensure that the MATLAB 'Current Folder' is the directory of the specific example.

Please report any issues/bugs to Roshan S. Kaundinya (roshan.kaundinya@mavt.ethz.ch)

# Temporally aperiodic SSMs

This package computes non-autonomous aperiodic spectral submanifolds and their corresponding reduced dynamics for four mechanical example situtaions subjected to chaotic shaking. 

The theory, computational methodology and further details on the examples can be found in the following article:

In order to install the program, simply run the install.m file in the main folder. The examples can be found in the examples directory. Note: When running the examples in the livescript files (workbooks), please ensure that the MATLAB 'Current Folder' is the directory of the specific example.

Please report any issues/bugs to Roshan S. Kaundinya (roshan.kaundinya@mavt.ethz.ch)
